# VideoGameSalesAnalysis

I created 7 different excel files from the Video Game Sales dataset which I downloaded from Kaggle.
Games file has 173 games. This is our main table.
Video game sales file has 46292 rows, 142 countries, and game platforms such as PS4, PC, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch.
There are other files like Publishers, Developers and Critics and Critic Score.
In the SQL file, there are descriptions and solutions for different questions. 
In the Tableau file, I created two dashboards to analyze game sales across the world. For this task I used VideogamesSales.csv file.
